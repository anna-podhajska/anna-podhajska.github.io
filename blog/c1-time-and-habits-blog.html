      <h4>time and habits</h4>
      <p> Time management techniques are useful, I think.</p>
      <p>So far, I tried pomodoro timebox technique, it works for me and I want to keep using it. Daily Scrum  seems to be another useful technique, I spent 15 min planning attack for the daily tasks in the morning and it helped me to stay on track. Timebox techniques are also really interesting. I'm planning to work in small iterations and to note time spent on different tasks. </p> <p> The challenge might be conditioning myself and creating a habit of making breaks off the desk, which is really important for my back pain. </p>
