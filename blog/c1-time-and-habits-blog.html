          <p> Time management techniques are useful, I think ...</p>
          <p> So far, I tried pomodoro timebox technique, it works for me and I want to keep using it. I also tried Daily Scrum and spent 15 min planning attack for the daily tasks in the morning. I'm planning to keep using the techniques, work in small iterations and to note time spent on different tasks. </p> <p> The challenge might be conditioning myself and creating a habit of making breaks off the desk, which is important for my back pain. </p>
