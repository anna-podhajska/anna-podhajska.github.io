        <h5>How did you find the Siberian North Railroad exercise (Stop, Breathe, Notice, Reflect, Respond)?</h5>
        <p>It gives me more confidence and objectivity. Simply stopping, taking a deep breath before reacting to stressful situation helps to handle the situation better. In some cases, when possible, observing intense feelings moving through the body but not sticking to it is also a great way of noticing, accepting and handling difficult situations. In situations when anger or stress is caused by another person, being able to stop, breathe and notice before reacting gives an opportunity to understand why the other person behaves in the way that might be annoying to us.</p>
