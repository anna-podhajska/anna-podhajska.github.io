        <h5>When programming, what are some of your triggers? What causes a disproportionate emotional response?</h5>
        <p>I get stressed when I don't fully understand the task and I do not have enough time to learn. Another trigger is code which I think should work, but it does not actually work at all and the situation lasts for longer time.</p>

        <h5>How did you find the Siberian North Railroad exercise (Stop, Breathe, Notice, Reflect, Respond)?</h5>
        <p>It gives me more confidence and objectivity. Simply stopping, taking a deep breath before reacting to stressful situation helps to handle the situation better. In some cases, when possible, observing intense feelings moving through the body but not sticking to it is also a great way of noticing, accepting and handling difficult situations. In situations when anger or stress is caused by another person, being able to stop, breathe and notice before reacting gives an opportunity to understand why the other person behaves in the way that might be annoying to us.</p>
