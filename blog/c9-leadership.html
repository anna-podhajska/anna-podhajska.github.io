        <p class="bookSignature black"> Answering some questions to the book asked by EDA:</p>


        <h5>Compassionate (or not) leadership</h5>
        <p class="quote lazur2">
          “Compassion is a mental state endowed with a sense of concern for the suffering of others and aspiration to see that suffering relieved.”
        </p>
        <p class="bookSignature">
          Excerpt From: Tan, Chade-Meng. “Search Inside Yourself: The Unexpected Path to Achieving Success, Happiness (and World Peace).”
        </p>
        <p>
          Compassion along with ambition and humility are features of great leaders. I worked both with compassionate and not compassionate leaders in Poland and Ireland. However, those that stay close to me and with whom I would willingly work again are those compassionate ones. Compassion has very real business benefits that result in stronger relationships, engagement and as a result trust and work quality.

        <h5>Multiplying goodness meditation</h5>
        <p>
          I believe that it is possible to create mental habits (and to create new neurological connections that support the new behaviour) by meditation. The idea seems similar to one of the aspects of behaviourism where the new habit is a result of brain creating new connections when <em>action</em> and <em>reaction</em> are repeated long enough. All this may simply be called different ways of learning ...
          <br>
          I find the multiplying goodness meditation strengthening compassion.
        </p>


        <h5>Tonglen meditation</h5>
        <p>
          “Tonglen" means “giving and receiving in Tibetan.
          <br>
          Since our brains respond far more strongly to negative experiences than comparable positive ones, this practice seems powerful and useful however difficult for novice.
        </p>


        <h5>Difficult conversation</h5>
        <p>
          From my experience, those are the conversations that we unconsciously avoid and prepare for them better than usually. I believe that being calm, open-minded, focused on solving the problem and compassionate helps handling the conversation, and the conversation result may be very satisfying.
        </p>



        <p class="quote lazur2 smaller"> “This shift is the transformation from “I” to “We.” It is the most important process leaders go through in becoming authentic. How else can they unleash the power of their organizations unless they motivate people to reach their full potential? If our supporters are merely following our lead, then their efforts are limited to our vision and our directions.... Only when leaders stop focusing on their personal ego needs are they able to develop other leaders.2”
