        <!-- <h4>Compassionate (or not) leadership</h4> -->
        <p id="q1" class="question">
          What is your experience of compassionate (or not) leadership?
        </p>
        <p id="a1" class="answer">
          Compassion along with ambition and humility are features of great leaders. I worked both with compassionate and not compassionate leaders in Poland and Ireland. Compassion has very real business benefits that result in stronger relationships, engagement and as a result trust and better work quality.
        </p>


        <!-- <h4>Multiplying goodness meditation</h4> -->
        <p id="q2" class="question">
           Do the multiplying goodness meditation. How did you find it?
         </p>
        <p id="a2" class="answer">
          The idea seems similar to one of the aspects of behaviourism where the new habit is a result of brain creating new connections when <em>action</em> and <em>reaction</em> are repeated long enough. All this may simply be called different ways of learning. I find the multiplying goodness meditation strengthening compassion.
        </p>

          How does the SCARF model apply to your Phase 0 experience so far? How will it apply to bootcamp?
        </p>
        <p id="a3" class="answer">
          to follow : -)

        <!-- <h4>Tonglen meditation</h4> -->
        <p id="q4" class="question">
          Do the Tonglen meditation. How did you find it?
        </p>
        <p id="a4" class="answer">
          “Tonglen" means “giving and receiving in Tibetan.
          Since our brains respond far more strongly to negative experiences than comparable positive ones, this practice seems powerful and useful however difficult for novice.
        </p>

        <!-- <h4>Difficult conversation</h4> -->
        <p id="q5" class="question">
          Have a difficult conversation. How did it go?
        </p>
        <p id="a5" class="answer">
          From my experience, those are the conversations that we unconsciously avoid and prepare for them better than usually. I believe that being calm, open-minded, focused on solving the problem and compassionate helps handling the conversation, and the conversation result may be very satisfying.
        </p>


        <p class="quote black smaller pushUp"> “This shift is the transformation from “I” to “We.” It is the most important process leaders go through in becoming authentic. How else can they unleash the power of their organizations unless they motivate people to reach their full potential? If our supporters are merely following our lead, then their efforts are limited to our vision and our directions.... Only when leaders stop focusing on their personal ego needs are they able to develop other leaders.2”
