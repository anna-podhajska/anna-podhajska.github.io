Read or watch chapter 6 of Search Inside Yourself, and reflect:
  How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?
  From the 'discovering values and higher purpose' exercise,
  What are your core values?
  What do you stand for?
  How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?
  Any other musings?

“In my own experience, mindfulness can increase my happiness without changing anything else. We take for granted many of the neutral things in life, such as not being in pain, having three meals a day, and being able to walk from point A to point B. In mindfulness, these become causes of joy because we no longer take them for granted. In addition, pleasant experiences become even more pleasant because our attention is there to fully experience them. ”

Excerpt From: Tan, Chade-Meng. “Search Inside Yourself: The Unexpected Path to Achieving Success, Happiness (and World Peace).” iBooks.
