        <p class="bookSignature">  “Search Inside Yourself: The Unexpected Path to Achieving Success, Happiness (and World Peace).” by Tan, Chade-Meng.</p>

        <h5>How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?</h5>
          <p>
            I agree that finding the purpose in business environment makes the work itself a pleasure, purpose also boosts the feeling of happiness. <br> Most of us already experienced passion, which as described by Meng is also known as “flow,” where peak performance meets peak engagement, and time flies by. I enjoy the feeling of flow when working.
          </p>

        <h5>From the 'discovering values and higher purpose' exercise, what are your core values and what do you stand for?</h5>

          <p class="quote lazur2"> My values are: can-do attitude, courage, quality, and kindness.<br>
          I stand for integrity and commitment; also believe it's possible to 'have fun for living'.</p>

        <h5>How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</h5>

          <p> Since success and failure manifest strongly in our bodies, the idea is to become comfortable with experiencing these emotions in our bodies. For example, we let go aversion that arises along with failure, and with time we become emotionally resilient to success and failure.</p>

        <h5>Any other musings?</h5>

          <quote class="brown quote">Whatever one frequently thinks and ponders upon, that will become the inclination of his mind.</quote>
