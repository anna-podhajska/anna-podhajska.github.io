            <p class="description">I was blocked on a simple things as missing semicolon in the code many times. We’re humans and it is quite easy to omit small things, as for example missing symbol, wrong syntax, or a typo. To solve a problem, I usually check the code couple of times and use chrome debugger. If the problem still exists and I am sure that I run out of ideas, then I ask someone for the code review. However, before that I explain what I did to the "reviewer" and sometimes, it is just enough to find the problem by my own! <em>Small errors</em> are easy to make and often hard to find.</p>

            <p class="description">I recently had a larger problem connected with incorrect usage of one of the loops in a program. At first, I did not see the error and got frustrated since the code <em>should</em> work, but it didn't. Since begging the code to work did not give much chance for the success, I started going line by line in the code with full understanding what each line doeas. I also used chrome debugger. Summing up, I tried to question my assumptions, find patterns and anything that may interrupt them, looked for things that seem to be odd, missing, or shouldn't be in the code. I also tried not to do any unnecessary code re-factorig while looking for the bug, unless it led to the code simplifying. I can't resist myself at this point.</p>

          <p class="description">Googling is usually a quick way to find resources or someone else who already has already had a similar problem. Reading error messages, no matter whether they come from git or debugger, is a useful habit. It is surprising how many people do not read them. Writing a pseudocode seems useful especially when solving some more complex problem, it helps to simplify it.</p>
