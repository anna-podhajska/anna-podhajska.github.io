          <p>What is grid based design??</p>
          <p>It is an approach to designing pages based on dividing the page layout into a grid. The grid usually consists of 12 columns and various number of rows. Objects in html document receive a class that relates to their size. The width is related to the number of columns that particular element will take. For example an image wrapped in &#60div class="col-4"&#62 will later receive the following CSS styling: <p class="parShowCss" <br> .col-4 { <br> width: 33.33%; <br> } </p> <br> where 33.33% is 4/12 of the page's width.</p>

          <p>Whats all the hype about responsive webpages?</p>
          <p>Basically, it is related to modern way of using the Internet and viewing webpages on devices that have various screen resolution. Responsive webpages adjust to different screen sizes, screen orientation and platforms. The approach consists of using flexible grids and CSS media queries. For example, using media queries it is possible to "turn off" some images on the page if the screen resolution is to small to view them properly. </p>

          <p>What is semantic structure?</p>
          <p>Semantic structure of html has little interest in design. It consists of semantic elements that are easy to read both by people and browsers. The semantic elements are for example headings &#60h1&#62 to &#60h5&#62, images &#60img&#62, tables &#60table&#62. Pages should be structured in a hierarchical manner, so for example headings &#60h1&#62 are more important than &#60h5&#62. <br> In those words, semantic structure is a meaningful structure of a html document which describes and identifies relations between its elements. </p>
