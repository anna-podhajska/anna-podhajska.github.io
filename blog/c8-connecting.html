        <h5 class="quote red"> “Empathy is not psychologizing or agreeing”</h5>

        <h5> Try empathic listening - how did it go?</h5>
          <p> It was great to both of us. <br> I also try praising people and find it a great way to get the best of people. It works a bit like positive reinforcement.</p>

        <h5>How did you find the loving kindness meditation?</h5>
          <p>
            I like the informal way to practice, which is simply to generating these thoughts every time you meet people.

            Situation - my very old company grew, and the number of business travel increased significantly. Budget spent on business travel was already counted in millions, it was incredibly difficult to manage all trips for all company sites, there was a need for travel process and tools improvements.
          </p>
          <p>
            My team's objective was improving travel-related processes in order to manage the growing travel numbers. Long story short, one of many things needed at the time was replacing an old ticketing system with a new one. The old system that was used and adopted by travel desk was designed for other purpose, could not handle reports, and had lots of other limitations. If any improvements were possible then they were time-taking, full of bugs, and required work-arounds.
          </p>
          <p>
            The company understood the need of improvement. However it was also dealing with other issues at the time, it was close to selling one of the departments, and additional savings had to be made in all areas. Despite initial approval, it was not possible to buy a new system at that time.
