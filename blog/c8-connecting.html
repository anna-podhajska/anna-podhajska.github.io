        <h5> Try empathic listening - how did it go?</h5>
          <p> It was great to both of us. <br> I also try praising people and find it a great way to get the best of people. It works a bit like positive reinforcement.</p>

        <h5>How did you find the loving kindness meditation?</h5>
          <p>
            I like the informal way to practice, which is simply to generating these thoughts every time you meet people.

            Situation - my old company grew, and the number of business travel increased significantly. Budget spent on business travel was already counted in millions, it was incredibly difficult to manage all trips, there was a need for travel process and tools improvement.
          </p>
          <p>
            My objective was improving travel-related processes in order to manage the growing travel numbers and reduce their cost. Long story short, one of many things needed at the time was replacing an old ticketing system with a new one. The old system had lots of limitations, and if any improvements were possible then they were not easy to make and required work-arounds.
          </p>
          <p>
            The company understood the need of improvement. However it was also dealing with other issues at the time, it was close to selling one of the departments, and additional savings had to be made in all areas. Despite initial approval, it was not possible to buy a new system at the time.
