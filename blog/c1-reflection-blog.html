    <h3>Reflections</h3>

      <div>
      <p> My attitude towards EDA and the learning programme is very positive. </p>
      <p> The culture in the campus seems more relaxed and focused at the same time than the <i> IT culture </i> I know from my country. Also, it looks like the school provides natural learning environment similar to that one which is in companies. This is great opportunity for people without commercial experience or for those who are used to something different.
      <p> I am very excited about the training. We will have lots of fun when working together in the kohort. Everyone is different and all have their challenges but those things change fast. We can already learn from each other and I am sure that everyone will be flying soon. </p>
      <p> My expectations from EDA have not changed. To be honest, I have more expectations from myself than from EDA.</p>
