      <h4>reflection</h4>
      <p> My attitude towards EDA and the learning programme is very positive. </p>
      <p> The culture in the campus seems both more relaxed and focused than the so called <i> IT culture </i> I know from my country. It looks like the campus provides natural learning environment. It is an amazing oportunity for students without commercial experience and makes learning easier for those who already have it.
      <p> I am very excited about the training. I believe this training will help me at work. Also, I am pretty sure that we will have lots of fun working together in the kohort. Everyone is different and we all face different challenges but those things change fast. We can already learn from each other and I am sure that everyone will be flying soon. </p>
      <p> My expectations from EDA have not changed. To be honest, I have more expectations from myself than from EDA.</p>
