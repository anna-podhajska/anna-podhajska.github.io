      <p> My attitude towards EDA and the learning programme is positive... </p>
      <p> The culture in the campus is great. The campus provides natural learning environment to students. It is an amazing oportunity for those without commercial experience and makes learning easier for those who already have it. I am excited about the training and believe that new skills will be useful at work.
      <p> Also, I am pretty sure that there will be lots of fun working together in the kohort. Everyone is different and we all face different challenges but those things change fast. We can already learn from each other and I am sure that everyone will be flying soon. </p>
      <p> My expectations from EDA have not changed. To be honest, I have more expectations from myself than from EDA.</p>
