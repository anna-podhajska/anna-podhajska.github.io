    <h3>Reflections</h3>

      <div>
      <p> I have a positive attitude towards EDA and my learning at the academy </p>
      <p> This type of culture makes me feel comfortable. It seems more relaxed and focused at the same time than the <i> IT culture </i> I know from my country. Also, it looks like the school provides real and natural learning environment. This is great opportunity for people without commercial experience.
      <p> I am very excited about the training. We will have lots of fun when working together in the kohort. Everyone is at a bit different level and have their challenges but those things change fast. We can already learn from each other and I am sure that everyone will be flying soon. </p>
      <p> My expectations from EDA have not changed and to be honest, I do have more expectations from myself than from EDA.</p>
